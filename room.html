            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> First, we need to run a scan on the virus sample sampl3[.]exe to see what we can find.</p>
            <img src="dnns.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> This virus also makes requests, but this time to specific domains instead of direct IP addresses. This method is advantageous for hackers because it helps them hide their true IP address, making it harder for security systems to trace the origin of the attack. By using domain names, attackers can also leverage techniques like Dynamic DNS or cloud-based services to further obscure their location.</p>
            <img src="dnsrule.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Let's set up a DNS rule to block any connection to this Domain, Creating a DNS rule to block a domain involves configuring your network or firewall to prevent any device on your network from resolving a specific domain to its associated IP address. When a device tries to access a domain, the DNS server translates the domain name into an IP address. By creating a DNS block rule, you're essentially telling the DNS server to deny the request to resolve that domain, making it impossible for the malware or malicious activity to reach its destination.</p>

            <img src="registrac.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> This virus does even worse things, such as modifying the registry at Microsoft\Windows Defender\Real-Time Protection. This is the key for Windows Defender's Real-Time Protection. By tampering with it, the virus disables Windows Defender, preventing it from alerting the user to any malicious activity.</p>
            <img src="sigmarule.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Let's create a Sigma rule to detect this type of event, Sigma rules are a standardized, flexible way to define detection logic for various security events across different security platforms. They are designed to be platform-agnostic, meaning they can be used with any SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system to identify suspicious activities.</p>

            <img src="sample5.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> This virus is even worse because it makes a lot of POST requests to a specific IP. To avoid detection, it establishes a connection every 30 minutes and sends a request of size 97 bytes. It's like it's communicating with a C2 (Command and Control) server</p>
            <img src="c2.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Let's create a Sigma rule to detect and block any attempts to connect to this specific Command and Control (C2) server. Sigma rules allow us to define detection patterns for suspicious activities across different security platforms. In this case, the rule would be designed to identify any network traffic trying to establish a connection with the identified C2 server, and then block it to prevent the malware from communicating with its attacker. By implementing this rule, we can strengthen our defenses and prevent the malware from receiving further commands or exfiltrating data</p>

            <p><strong>Info:</strong> The Principal should now show "Everyone," and the permissions will allow you to specify which actions to audit on the Secret Document. For a broader selection, click Show advanced permissions in the top-right corner. Once you're done, click OK, then Apply and OK on the Audit entry page, and finally, click OK on the Secret Document properties. If you're tracking multiple files, it’s recommended to organize them into folders for easier auditing. The setup is now complete, and auditing is active for the Secret Document. Any access attempts will be logged in the Security event log with Event ID 4663, which can be filtered and used to generate alerts, allowing analysts to quickly detect when a tripwire is triggered, thereby enhancing the organization's security.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Snort is a powerful open-source network intrusion detection system (IDS) and intrusion prevention system (IPS) developed by Martin Roesch and maintained by Cisco Systems. It analyzes network traffic in real-time, identifying suspicious patterns or behaviors that may indicate a security threat. With its extensive rule-based language, Snort can detect attacks, log malicious traffic, and even block it when configured as an IPS.</p>
        <p><strong>Challenge Approach:</strong> Setting up Snort</p>
        <div class="question-section">
            <p><strong>Let's do it</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-section" id="solution-room5" style="display: none;">
            <p><strong>Info:</strong>Let's start by installing Snort. You can find the information on this website: snort[.]org.</p>
            <p><strong>Installation:</strong> If you're using Linux, you can install Snort by running the following command:</p>
            <div class="terminal">
                <span class="prompt">$</span> sudo apt install snort -y
            </div>
            <p><strong>Info:</strong>  Setting up Snort using the -X option for full packet dump mode.</p>
            <p><strong>Info:</strong>  These are different switches, such as verbose mode (-v), using the interface (-i), dumping packet data mode (-d), dump (-d), and link-layer header grabbing (-e).</p>
            <p><strong>Info:</strong> Sending a ping request to the machine to check if Snort is able to detect it</p>
            <div class="terminal">
                <span class="prompt">$</span> sudo snort -X
            </div>

            <div class="terminal">
                <span class="prompt">$</span> ping -c 5 VICTIM-IP
            </div>
            <img src="pin2.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            <p><strong>Info:</strong>  Run Snort in Logger Mode.</p>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Before diving into generating and analyzing logs, it's crucial to understand Linux file ownership and permissions. Snort requires superuser (root) privileges to sniff network traffic. When you run Snort using the sudo command, any log files it creates will be owned by the root account. As a result, you'll need root privileges to access and analyze these log files.</p>
            <p><strong>Info:</strong>  Logging with parameter "-l".</p>
            <div class="terminal">
                <span class="prompt">$</span> sudo snort -dev -l .
            </div>
            <p><strong>Info:</strong> Snort captures and logs packets to a specified directory, which can be set in the snort.config file. Alternatively, you can use the -l option to specify a custom directory for log files. While the default log directory is ideal for ongoing monitoring, the -l option is particularly handy for testing scenarios, For example, using -l . in the command saves the logs directly to the current working directory.</p>

            <p><strong>Info:</strong> On examining the generated folders, you'll notice that the logs are stored in an organized, categorized format and saved as ASCII files. This means the logs can be easily read and analyzed directly, without requiring a Snort instance to interpret them.</p>
            <p><strong>Info:</strong> In ASCII mode, logs are stored in a human-readable format and split into multiple files, making it easy to view them with a simple text editor. On the other hand, logs in binary format are not readable by humans and must be analyzed using tools like Snort or tcpdump to make sense of the data.</p>

            <p><strong>Info:</strong> This rule is located in "/etc/snort/rules/local.rules"</p>
            <p><strong>Info:</strong> Snort generates an "alert" file whenever it detects traffic that matches one of its alert rules. Additionally, when you run Snort in IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) or IDS (Intrusion Detection System) mode, its sniffing and logging functions operate in a semi-passive manner by default. To fully utilize these features, you can enable them explicitly using various parameters, such as:</p>
            <p><strong>paramaters:</strong><br>-i: Specify the network interface to monitor.<br>-v: Run in verbose mode to display packet details.<br>-d: Decode application layer data.<br>-e: Include link-layer information.<br>-X: Display full packet details in hexadecimal and ASCII.<br>-l: Define the logging directory.<br>-K ASCII: Save logs in plain text format for easier reading.<br></p>

            <p><strong>Inportant:</strong> When you run Snort with specific parameters like -v (verbosity) or -X (full packet dump), the requested information will be displayed directly in the terminal. However, this means Snort won't save any logs to the designated log folder. Essentially, enabling these options redirects the output to the console instead of creating log files.</p>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> To activate Snort in IPS mode, you can use the -Q parameter along with --daq afpacket. Alternatively, you can enable IPS mode by modifying the snort.conf file. The Data Acquisition (DAQ) modules are essential for IPS functionality. Using the afpacket module allows Snort to act as an IPS. For example, specify the interfaces like this: -i eth0:eth1. It's important to note that Snort in IPS mode requires at least two network interfaces—one for incoming traffic and another for outgoing traffic.</p>

            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Snort is not just for monitoring network traffic, logging data, or identifying and blocking threats. It also has a feature called "PCAP read/investigate mode," which allows you to analyze PCAP files. When you load a PCAP file into Snort, it processes the data and provides you with traffic statistics by default, along with any alerts based on the rules you've set up. This means you can investigate network traffic that has already been captured in a PCAP file, not just live traffic.</p>
            <p><strong>Info:</strong> When you read a PCAP file without using any specific settings or parameters, Snort will just give you a basic overview of the packets and provide general statistics about the file. This is usually not very helpful. The real advantage of using Snort to analyze a PCAP file comes when you apply Snort's rules, which allow you to identify known threat patterns. This makes the investigation process faster and more efficient by automatically detecting potential threats based on these predefined patterns.</p>

            <p><strong>Info:</strong>  snort identified the traffic, distinguished each pcap file and prompted the alerts according to our ruleset. </p>
            <p><strong>Question:</strong> How does a Snort rule really work?</p>
            <img src="snorul.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            <p><strong>Info:</strong> A Snort rule defines an action, protocol, source and destination IPs, source and destination ports, and options to specify conditions for detecting or responding to network traffic.</p>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> By default, Snort operates in passive mode, meaning it only monitors network traffic and alerts you about suspicious activity, functioning as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). To enable Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) functionality, where Snort can actively block malicious traffic, you need to switch it to "inline mode."</p>
            <p><strong>Info:</strong> The Snort rule structure is easy to understand but difficult to produce. You should be familiar with rule options and related details to create efficient rules. </p>
            <p><strong>Info:</strong> Rules cannot be processed without a header, which is mandatory, while rule options are optional. However, without using rule options, it becomes nearly impossible to detect complex or advanced attacks.</p>

  <div id="room6" class="collapsible-content">
      <img src="cyberkillchain.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Cyber Kill Chain is a systematic model developed by Lockheed Martin that outlines the stages of a cyberattack, providing organizations with a framework to understand, detect, and disrupt adversary activities. This chain highlights the steps attackers take, from initial reconnaissance to achieving their final objectives, such as data theft or operational disruption. By breaking the attack into stages, defenders can develop strategies to protect systems and stop adversaries before significant damage occurs.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge Approach:</strong> Understanding and leveraging the Cyber Kill Chain requires knowledge of the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by attackers. Tools like OpenCTI and the MITRE ATT&CK Navigator help security professionals map these TTPs to each stage of the chain, enabling precise identification of vulnerabilities and appropriate countermeasures. These platforms also allow analysts to cross-reference threat intelligence reports and gain insights into threat actor motives and methods, ultimately enhancing an organization's defensive posture.</p>

      <div class="solution-section" id="solution-room6" style="display: none;">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the Cyber Kill Chain?</p>
        <p>The Cyber Kill Chain is a framework that describes the steps attackers take to execute a cyberattack. It helps organizations understand the attacker’s workflow and identify opportunities to disrupt the attack. The chain includes seven stages: Recon, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command and Control (C2), and Actions on Objectives. Understanding and intervening at each stage can prevent attacks from succeeding.</p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the first stage of the Cyber Kill Chain?</p>
        <p><strong>1. Recon:</strong> During the reconnaissance stage, attackers gather information about their target. This could involve:
        <ul>
          <li>Passive Recon: Searching public sources (e.g., LinkedIn, Shodan, social media, company websites).</li>
          <li>Active Recon: Scanning for vulnerabilities, open ports, or exposed services using tools like Nmap or Nessus.</li>
        </ul>
        To protect against this stage:
        <ul>
          <li>Limit the information available publicly (e.g., remove unnecessary metadata from documents).</li>
          <li>Implement network monitoring to detect scanning activities.</li>
          <li>Use deception technologies, such as honeypots, to mislead attackers.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What happens in the weaponization stage?</p>
        <p><strong>2. Weaponize:</strong> Attackers create a payload (e.g., malware, exploit) based on the information gathered. The payload is designed to exploit a vulnerability and deliver a foothold in the target system. For example, an attacker may create a malicious document with embedded macros.
        To protect against weaponization:
        <ul>
          <li>Maintain up-to-date patching to reduce exploitable vulnerabilities.</li>
          <li>Conduct threat intelligence to anticipate and block known malware types.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> How does the payload reach the target?</p>
        <p><strong>3. Delivery:</strong> In this stage, attackers deliver the payload to the victim. Common methods include phishing emails with malicious attachments, drive-by downloads from compromised websites, or physical methods like USB drives.
        To disrupt delivery:
        <ul>
          <li>Implement email filtering to detect and block phishing attempts.</li>
          <li>Educate employees about recognizing phishing and suspicious links.</li>
          <li>Limit access to unnecessary USB ports or external devices.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What marks the transition from delivery to exploitation?</p>
        <p><strong>4. Exploitation:</strong> The delivered payload is executed on the victim’s machine, exploiting a vulnerability to gain access. For example, this could be a zero-day exploit or a macro-enabled document triggering malicious code.
        To mitigate exploitation:
        <ul>
          <li>Use application whitelisting to block unauthorized programs.</li>
          <li>Enforce strong user permissions and minimize admin rights.</li>
          <li>Deploy endpoint protection tools to detect suspicious activity.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> How does the attacker maintain their presence?</p>
        <p><strong>5. Installation:</strong> Malware is installed on the system, creating persistence. This could involve backdoors, droppers, or rootkits to maintain control of the compromised system.
        To disrupt installation:
        <ul>
          <li>Use application monitoring to detect unauthorized installations.</li>
          <li>Deploy anti-malware tools to identify and block malicious files.</li>
          <li>Conduct regular scans for anomalies in file integrity.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the purpose of command and control (C2)?</p>
        <p><strong>6. Command and Control:</strong> Attackers establish a communication channel with the compromised machine. This allows them to issue commands, exfiltrate data, or download additional tools. They may use encrypted channels or legitimate protocols to avoid detection.
        To disrupt C2:
        <ul>
          <li>Monitor for unusual outbound connections or traffic patterns.</li>
          <li>Block access to known malicious IP addresses or domains.</li>
          <li>Use DNS filtering to prevent connections to malicious sites.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the final stage of the Cyber Kill Chain?</p>
        <p><strong>7. Actions on Objectives:</strong> This is the attacker’s end goal, which may involve data exfiltration, deploying ransomware, or further lateral movement within the network.
        To protect against this stage:
        <ul>
          <li>Implement robust data encryption to protect sensitive information.</li>
          <li>Use monitoring tools to detect and respond to unusual data access or transfer.</li>
          <li>Conduct regular incident response drills to prepare for potential attacks.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Can the stages of the Cyber Kill Chain repeat?</p>
        <p>Yes, attackers may revisit earlier stages, such as recon or exploitation, to expand their foothold. For example, once inside the network, they might perform internal reconnaissance to find additional targets. 
        Proactively disrupting the attack early in the chain minimizes damage and reduces the attacker’s chances of success.</p>

  <h2 onclick="toggleContent('room7')">Incident Handling Process 👲 </h2>
  <div id="room7" class="collapsible-content">
      <img src="incidenthan.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Incident Handling Process is a systematic approach designed to help organizations respond to and recover from security incidents. The process consists of four stages: Preparation, Detection and Analysis, Containment/Eradication/Recovery, and Post-Incident Activities. It enables incident handlers to proactively prepare for potential threats, detect malicious events early, contain and recover from incidents effectively, and learn from past incidents to improve future responses. By following this cyclical process, organizations can ensure a swift and coordinated response to security breaches and minimize the impact of cyberattacks.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge Approach:</strong> The Incident Handling Process requires a strong understanding of the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used during an incident. By utilizing frameworks like NIST’s guidelines and leveraging technologies for monitoring, detection, and recovery, organizations can stay ahead of potential threats. Incident response teams use these resources to identify compromised systems, mitigate ongoing attacks, and restore normal operations. After an incident, post-incident activities, such as lessons learned and root cause analysis, ensure that organizations can improve their preparedness for future attacks.</p>

      <div class="solution-section" id="solution-room7" style="display: none;">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the Incident Handling Process?</p>
        <p>The Incident Handling Process is a structured framework used by organizations to prepare for, detect, respond to, and learn from security incidents. It enables organizations to minimize damage, recover efficiently, and prevent similar incidents in the future. The process, as defined by NIST, has four key stages: Preparation, Detection and Analysis, Containment/Eradication/Recovery, and Post-Incident Activities. It is dynamic and cyclic, meaning steps may need to be revisited as new evidence arises.</p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What are the stages of the Incident Handling Process?</p>
        <p><strong>1. Preparation:</strong> This stage focuses on equipping the organization with the tools, plans, and skills needed to respond to incidents. Examples include creating an incident response plan, conducting regular training, and ensuring the availability of key tools like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and logging mechanisms.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Detection and Analysis:</strong> The focus here is identifying potential incidents and determining their scope and impact. Organizations monitor systems for unusual activities using tools like SIEMs, analyze logs, and use threat intelligence to identify malicious events. Quick and accurate detection is critical to minimize damage.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery:</strong> After an incident is identified, this stage focuses on stopping the threat (containment), removing it (eradication), and restoring systems to normal operations (recovery). For example, isolating infected machines, removing malware, and restoring clean backups.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Post-Incident Activities:</strong> Once the incident is resolved, the organization documents the cause, impact, and response actions in an incident report. A "lessons learned" session is conducted to identify improvements in processes and defenses to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Why is the process considered cyclic?</p>
        <p>The Incident Handling Process is cyclic because, as new evidence is uncovered, teams may need to revisit earlier stages. For example, during recovery, additional infected machines might be discovered, requiring further containment and analysis. This ensures no gaps are left in the response process.</p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What are the two main activities in incident handling?</p>
        <p><strong>1. Investigation:</strong> This involves determining the "patient zero" (the first system compromised), understanding the attacker’s tools and techniques, and documenting affected systems and actions.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Recovery:</strong> After the investigation, organizations create and execute a recovery plan to remove threats and restore systems. Normal business operations should resume as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What happens after the incident is resolved?</p>
        <p>Once an incident is fully handled, a detailed report is created to document the cause, impact, and response actions. Additionally, "lessons learned" activities are conducted to identify weaknesses in current defenses and implement measures to prevent future incidents of the same nature.</p>
        <h1>the Preparation Stage</h1>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Establishing Incident Handling Capability:</strong> This involves setting up a team and processes to effectively manage incidents when they occur. The team needs to be ready to identify, respond to, and mitigate security incidents in an organized way.</li>
          <li><strong>Implementing Protective Measures:</strong> Although incident handling is not responsible for protection, having protective measures in place is vital for minimizing the likelihood and impact of incidents. These measures include things like securing endpoints, hardening servers, using multi-factor authentication, and managing privileged access.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Preparation Prerequisites</strong></p>
        <p>Before an incident occurs, several foundational elements must be in place:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Skilled Incident Handling Team Members:</strong> The organization should have knowledgeable team members, either in-house or outsourced, who understand incident handling. At a minimum, basic knowledge must exist internally.</li>
          <li><strong>Trained Workforce:</strong> Employees should be trained through security awareness activities or other training programs to recognize and report potential incidents.</li>
          <li><strong>Clear Policies and Documentation:</strong> Written procedures and policies should cover incident handling steps, roles, responsibilities, and communication plans. These documents will guide the team during an actual incident.</li>
          <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Both software and hardware tools are necessary for incident handling, such as forensic tools, network capture tools, and communication systems.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Clear Policies and Documentation</strong></p>
        <p>The documentation created in the preparation phase must include the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Incident Handling Team Contacts:</strong> Ensure all team members' roles and contact info are clearly outlined.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal and Compliance Contacts:</strong> Information for the legal team, law enforcement, external teams, and other departments that may need to be contacted during or after an incident.</li>
          <li><strong>Incident Response Procedures:</strong> Well-defined response plans, including procedures for information sharing, escalation, and collaboration.</li>
          <li><strong>Baseline Information:</strong> Knowledge of system configurations and network diagrams to understand what's "normal" and to quickly spot deviations during an incident.</li>
          <li><strong>User Accounts with Elevated Privileges:</strong> Pre-configured accounts with necessary privileges to allow the incident team to act swiftly during an incident, and that can be disabled after the incident is resolved.</li>
          <li><strong>Procurement Flexibility:</strong> The ability to quickly acquire tools or resources without bureaucratic delays to avoid slowdowns during critical moments.</li>
          <li><strong>Forensic/Investigative Cheat Sheets:</strong> Predefined checklists or procedures to guide investigators during the forensic process, minimizing mistakes in the heat of the moment.</li>
          <li><strong>Compliance Knowledge:</strong> Familiarize the team with legal and compliance requirements related to incidents, such as data breach notification laws (e.g., GDPR).</li>
          <li><strong>Effective Reporting Capability:</strong> During an incident, accurate documentation is essential. Teams should document every step taken with precise timestamps, results, and personnel involved, focusing on the "who, what, when, where, why, and how."</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Tools (Software & Hardware)</strong></p>
        <p>Having the right tools is crucial. These tools should enable the team to capture, preserve, and analyze evidence, as well as respond to incidents effectively:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Laptops/Workstations:</strong> Devices used for investigation, free of corporate security software (e.g., antivirus), to prevent interference with the analysis of malware.</li>
          <li><strong>Forensic Tools:</strong> Software for acquiring disk images, capturing memory, analyzing logs, and identifying Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).</li>
          <li><strong>Network Tools:</strong> Network capture and analysis tools, network cables, and switches for investigating network traffic during an incident.</li>
          <li><strong>Hardware Tools:</strong> Items like write blockers (to preserve evidence), screwdrivers, and power cables for dealing with physical devices or equipment during investigations.</li>
          <li><strong>Incident Handling System:</strong> A system for tracking incidents, documenting actions, and managing the incident lifecycle.</li>
          <li><strong>Jump Bag:</strong> A portable set of tools that the team can grab quickly to respond to an incident without wasting time gathering resources.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Additional Considerations</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Independent Documentation System:</strong> It's critical that the incident documentation system is separate from the organization's infrastructure. This ensures that in case of a compromise, the documentation remains safe and available.</li>
          <li><strong>Communication Channels:</strong> Use communication tools that are separate from the organization's systems. If adversaries have control over your network, email and internal systems may be compromised, so secure external communication channels are needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Protecting Against Incidents</strong></p>
        <p>Although protecting against incidents isn't directly the responsibility of an incident handling team, it’s crucial for them to be aware of protection efforts. By understanding what protective measures are in place, they can better identify and analyze threats, and know where to look for evidence during an incident investigation.</p>

        <p><strong>Key Protective Measures</strong></p>

        <p><strong>DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: DMARC is an email protection mechanism that helps prevent phishing by verifying the authenticity of incoming emails. It works on top of <strong>SPF</strong> (Sender Policy Framework) and <strong>DKIM</strong> (DomainKeys Identified Mail).</p>
        <p><strong>How it works</strong>: If an email pretends to come from your organization, DMARC helps reject it before it reaches the recipient.</p>
        <p><strong>Challenge</strong>: While easy to set up, thorough testing is necessary to avoid blocking legitimate emails unintentionally. False positives can occur, especially with emails sent from third-party services that may fail DMARC checks.</p>

        <p><strong>Endpoint Hardening & EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Endpoint Hardening</strong>: This involves securing endpoint devices (like workstations and laptops), which are often the primary entry points for attackers. Recommended actions include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Disabling <strong>LLMNR</strong> and <strong>NetBIOS</strong> to reduce risks from local network-based attacks.</li>
          <li>Implementing <strong>LAPS</strong> (Local Administrator Password Solution) to manage admin privileges.</li>
          <li>Restricting <strong>PowerShell</strong> to prevent misuse by attackers.</li>
          <li>Enabling <strong>Attack Surface Reduction</strong> rules in security tools like <strong>Microsoft Defender</strong>.</li>
          <li>Whitelisting applications, which involves blocking the execution of unauthorized files from places like user directories.</li>
          <li>Using <strong>host-based firewalls</strong> to limit unnecessary network traffic.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>EDR Solutions</strong>: Implement <strong>EDR</strong> tools to detect malicious behavior and provide deeper visibility into threats on endpoints.</p>

        <p><strong>Network Protection</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Network Segmentation</strong>: Isolating business-critical systems to prevent attackers from easily spreading across the network. Systems should only have access as required for their business function.</p>
        <p><strong>IDS/IPS</strong> (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems): These tools help detect and prevent malicious traffic. When <strong>SSL/TLS interception</strong> is used, these systems can analyze traffic content directly, improving detection accuracy.</p>
        <p><strong>Device Control</strong>: Implement solutions like <strong>802.1x</strong> or <strong>Conditional Access</strong> to ensure only approved devices can access the network.</p>

        <p><strong>Privilege Identity Management, MFA, and Strong Passwords</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Privilege Identity Management</strong>: Protect administrative accounts by reducing exposure to attacks that steal privileged credentials.</p>
        <p><strong>MFA (Multi-factor Authentication)</strong>: Implement MFA, particularly for administrative access to sensitive systems and applications.</p>
        <p><strong>Password Management</strong>: Encourage employees to use <strong>strong passphrases</strong> rather than weak passwords. Passphrases are longer and more difficult to guess, e.g., “i LIK3 my coffeE warm.” A combination of languages can enhance security further.</p>

        <p><strong>Vulnerability Scanning</strong></p>
        <p>Conduct continuous scans of your environment to identify vulnerabilities. Critical or high-risk vulnerabilities should be prioritized for patching. Systems that can’t be patched should be segmented to limit potential exposure.</p>

        <p><strong>User Awareness Training</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Security Awareness</strong>: Regularly train users to recognize and report suspicious activity. Conduct surprise tests like <strong>phishing</strong> simulations to gauge employee vigilance.</p>

        <p><strong>Active Directory Security Assessment</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Active Directory</strong> (AD) is often targeted for privilege escalation attacks. Conduct regular assessments of AD configurations and security controls to ensure that attackers can’t easily escalate their privileges.</p>
        <p><strong>Third-Party Audits</strong>: If the in-house team lacks expertise, hire third-party auditors to help identify vulnerabilities.</p>

        <p><strong>Purple Team Exercises</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Purple Teaming</strong> combines the efforts of both red teams (attackers) and blue teams (defenders). These exercises help test the organization's security posture by simulating real-world attacks, identifying gaps in detection, and improving incident handling procedures.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Red Team</strong>: Simulates the attacks.</li>
          <li><strong>Blue Team</strong>: Works to detect, respond, and defend against the attacks.</li>
          <li><strong>Goal</strong>: Improve collaboration and effectiveness of both teams, enhance detection capabilities, and refine incident response playbooks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Detection & Analysis Stage</h1>
        <p>At this point, we have created processes, procedures, and guidelines on how to act upon security incidents.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Detection & Analysis</strong> phase involves detecting an incident using various sources, such as sensors, logs, and trained personnel. It also includes information and knowledge sharing, as well as utilizing context-based threat intelligence. Additionally, segmentation of the architecture and having clear visibility within the network are critical factors for effective detection.</p>

        <h3>Threat Detection Sources</h3>
        <p>Threats can be introduced to the organization via an infinite number of attack vectors, and detection can come from several sources:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Employee Reports</strong>: An employee noticing abnormal behavior.</li>
          <li><strong>Alerts from Tools</strong>: Alerts from tools like EDR, IDS, firewalls, SIEM, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Threat Hunting</strong>: Proactively looking for threats.</li>
          <li><strong>Third-Party Notifications</strong>: A third-party organization notifying you that your systems may be compromised.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Levels of Detection</h3>
        <p>It’s crucial to create layers of detection across the network:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Network Perimeter Detection</strong>: Using firewalls, IDS/IPS systems at the perimeter, and demilitarized zones (DMZs).</li>
          <li><strong>Internal Network Detection</strong>: Using local firewalls, host intrusion detection/prevention systems (HIDS/HIPS), etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Endpoint Detection</strong>: Using antivirus software, endpoint detection & response (EDR) systems, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Application Detection</strong>: Using application logs, service logs, etc.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Initial Investigation</h3>
        <p>When a security incident is detected, it’s essential to conduct some initial investigation to establish context before assembling the incident response team. Information must be gathered about:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Date/Time of the incident and who reported it.</li>
          <li>How the incident was detected.</li>
          <li>What the incident is (e.g., phishing, system unavailability).</li>
          <li>Impacted systems (if relevant).</li>
          <li>Who accessed impacted systems and what actions were taken.</li>
          <li>Physical location, OS, IP addresses, hostnames, and system owner information.</li>
          <li>If malware is involved, include relevant information such as IP addresses, date/time of detection, malware type, and forensic data (e.g., file hashes, copies of the files).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Incident Timeline</h3>
        <p>With the gathered information, start building an <strong>incident timeline</strong>. This timeline keeps you organized and provides a clear picture of what happened. The events are time-sorted based on when they occurred, but later investigation might reveal evidence in an unordered sequence.</p>

        <div class="table-container">
          <table border="1" style="width: 30%;">

        </div>
        <h3>Incident Severity & Extent Questions</h3>
        <p>When handling a security incident, answer the following questions to assess the severity and extent:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What is the exploitation impact?</li>
          <li>What are the exploitation requirements?</li>
          <li>Can any business-critical systems be affected?</li>
          <li>Are there suggested remediation steps?</li>
          <li>How many systems have been impacted?</li>
          <li>Is the exploit being used in the wild?</li>
          <li>Does the exploit have worm-like capabilities?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Incident Confidentiality & Communication</h3>
        <p>Incident-related information is highly confidential. All information should be kept on a need-to-know basis unless instructed otherwise. The appointed person will handle communication according to legal requirements.</p>
        <p>When an investigation begins, set expectations and goals, which may include the incident type, sources of evidence, and rough time estimates. As the investigation evolves, expectations and findings may change.</p>


          <p>In the <strong>Detection & Analysis</strong> stage, the focus is on understanding what happened during an incident and how it unfolded. It’s not enough to simply rebuild affected systems and move on. If we don't know how the attacker gained access or what was impacted, any remediation steps we take might not prevent them from regaining access. The goal is to figure out exactly how the adversary entered, what tools were used, and which systems were compromised. This detailed knowledge allows the response team to plan more effective remediation strategies that prevent the attack from recurring.</p>

          <h3>Investigation Process</h3>

          <p>The investigation starts with limited, initial information about the incident. Using this data, the incident handling team embarks on a <strong>cyclic process</strong> of investigation that iterates as new information is discovered. The three main steps in this process are:</p>

          <ol>
              <li><strong>Creation and usage of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Identification of new leads and impacted systems</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Data collection and analysis from the new leads and impacted systems</strong></li>
          </ol>

          <p>These steps are continuously repeated as more evidence comes in, refining the understanding of the attack.</p>

          <h3>Initial Investigation Data</h3>

          <p>The investigation must be based on reliable leads that are identified throughout the entire process. The initial phase is just the beginning. Investigators shouldn’t solely focus on one specific finding, such as a known malicious tool. Narrowing the investigation too early leads to incomplete conclusions and can miss important parts of the attack, resulting in a lack of full understanding of the incident’s impact.</p>

          <h3>Creation & Usage of IOCs</h3>

          <p><strong>Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)</strong> are evidence that an incident has taken place. These include things like IP addresses, file hashes, and file names. IOCs are used to track and document signs of compromise. OpenIOC and Yara are common standards used to create and share IOCs. Special tools, like Mandiant's IOC Editor, allow for creating and editing these indicators in a standardized format.</p>

          <p>Once IOCs are created, investigators use them with tools (native or third-party) to search for signs of compromise in systems. It's crucial to ensure that no privileged credentials are cached during this search process, as this can create new vulnerabilities. Using the correct tools that don't cache credentials (like WinRM or certain PowerShell commands) is essential during an investigation to avoid leaving traces on compromised systems.</p>

          <h3>Identification of New Leads & Impacted Systems</h3>

          <p>Once IOCs are applied to systems, hits (matches) can reveal additional compromised systems. However, not all hits will be directly related to the incident. Some may be false positives, or IOCs could be too broad. In such cases, investigators need to prioritize which systems to focus on, ideally starting with those that offer new leads that might be valuable in the investigation.</p>

          <h3>Data Collection & Analysis from New Leads & Impacted Systems</h3>

          <p>After identifying potentially impacted systems, data needs to be collected to understand the extent of the compromise. There are two main approaches to this:</p>

          <ul>
              <li><strong>Live Response</strong>: In this approach, the system is analyzed while it’s still running, collecting real-time data. This method is most commonly used, as it preserves running memory and other volatile data that might provide crucial evidence.</li>
              <li><strong>Shutting Down the System</strong>: In some cases, it may be necessary to shut down the system to prevent further harm. However, this risks losing valuable information stored in the system's volatile memory (RAM). Therefore, decisions on whether to shut down a system must be carefully considered.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Regardless of the method, it’s vital to minimize interaction with the system to avoid altering or corrupting any evidence.</p>

          <p>Once the data is collected, it’s analyzed, which often involves tasks like malware analysis and disk forensics. The process can be time-consuming, but it’s crucial for identifying how the attack unfolded. Memory forensics has also become an increasingly important capability, especially in more sophisticated attacks.</p>

          <h3>Chain of Custody</h3>

          <p>During the entire investigation, maintaining a <strong>chain of custody</strong> is essential. This ensures that any evidence collected can be legally used in court, if necessary. Proper documentation of each step in the collection process helps maintain the integrity of the evidence.</p>

          <h3>1. Containment</h3>
          <p><strong>Containment</strong> refers to actions taken to prevent the incident from spreading and causing further damage. It is divided into <strong>short-term</strong> and <strong>long-term</strong> containment:</p>

          <h3>Short-term Containment</h3>
          <p>The goal here is to quickly stop the attack's spread while keeping the system as intact as possible to preserve evidence for investigation. Examples of short-term containment include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Isolating affected systems</strong>: This could involve placing compromised systems in a separate network segment (VLAN) to prevent further communication with other systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Disconnecting from the network</strong>: Physically disconnecting systems from the network, such as pulling the network cables, can stop further exploitation.</li>
            <li><strong>Blocking Command and Control (C2) communication</strong>: If the attacker is using a specific domain or IP address for communication with compromised systems, redirecting or blocking that address can cut off the attacker's access.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Long-term Containment</h3>
          <p>This involves more permanent actions to ensure that the attacker cannot continue their activities in the system. Examples include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Changing passwords</strong>: Especially for administrative accounts that may have been compromised.</li>
            <li><strong>Applying security patches</strong>: Fixing any vulnerabilities that were exploited during the attack.</li>
            <li><strong>Adding security monitoring</strong>: Implementing host intrusion detection systems (HIDS) and more comprehensive firewall rules to detect any new malicious activity.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It's important that both short-term and long-term containment are coordinated across all impacted systems. Otherwise, the attacker might become aware of the response and change their tactics, evading detection.</p>

          <h3>2. Eradication</h3>
          <p><strong>Eradication</strong> focuses on completely removing the threat from the environment and fixing the root cause of the incident. The goal is to make sure the adversary is no longer present and that any remaining traces of the attack are eliminated.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Removing malware</strong>: Any malware discovered during the investigation phase should be completely removed from all affected systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Rebuilding systems</strong>: In some cases, it may be necessary to rebuild compromised systems from scratch to ensure that no hidden threats remain.</li>
            <li><strong>Restoring from backups</strong>: Systems that were heavily affected might need to be restored from known good backups.</li>
            <li><strong>Applying additional patches</strong>: If certain patches were not immediately applied during containment, they should be implemented now to further secure the system.</li>
            <li><strong>Hardening systems</strong>: Additional hardening measures (like improving system security configurations) should be taken to prevent similar attacks in the future.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Recovery</h3>
          <p><strong>Recovery</strong> involves bringing the affected systems back to normal operation. This stage focuses on ensuring that the systems are functional, secure, and able to support business operations once again. It's a careful and gradual process:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>System verification</strong>: The business or the relevant stakeholders need to verify that the systems are functioning correctly and that they contain all necessary data. This ensures the systems are not only operational but also safe from compromise.</li>
            <li><strong>Reintroducing systems into the production environment</strong>: Once verified, the systems are returned to normal operations and connected back to the production environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Ongoing monitoring</strong>: After recovery, systems need to be monitored closely, as they are often prime targets for attackers looking to re-enter the environment. Suspicious events to look out for include:
              <ul>
                <li>Unusual login attempts (e.g., unfamiliar user accounts or service accounts).</li>
                <li>Unexpected or suspicious processes running on systems.</li>
                <li>Unauthorized changes to system settings, particularly in areas commonly altered by malware (e.g., system registries).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Phased Recovery</h3>
          <p>In large-scale incidents, recovery may take a long time and can happen in phases. Early stages may focus on quick fixes like applying basic security measures (e.g., updating software, implementing firewalls), while later phases may focus on more permanent changes like improving overall security and performing system-wide hardening.</p>

          <h3>Post-Incident Activities</h3>
          <p>The recovery stage may also involve reviewing lessons learned and updating the organization’s incident response plan to better handle future attacks. During this time, the team will identify weaknesses in the existing defenses and work on improving security posture to prevent future incidents.</p>

          <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Containment</strong> stops the spread of the incident and limits damage by isolating affected systems and applying immediate fixes.</li>
            <li><strong>Eradication</strong> removes the root cause of the issue, such as malware, vulnerabilities, and compromised data.</li>
            <li><strong>Recovery</strong> brings systems back online in a secure state while closely monitoring for any signs of the attacker trying to regain access.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The main idea of these stages is to ensure that once the incident is contained, the organization works toward fully eradicating the threat and bringing systems back online securely, without leaving vulnerabilities that could be exploited again.</p>

          <h3>Post-Incident Activity Stage</h3>
          <p>The <strong>Post-Incident Activity Stage</strong> is the final phase of an incident response process, where the focus shifts from dealing with the immediate threat to learning from the experience and improving the organization’s response capabilities. The key objectives during this stage are to analyze what happened, document the incident, and reflect on how the response can be improved for future incidents. This stage also offers an opportunity to involve all the stakeholders who were part of the incident handling process to share insights and lessons learned. Here's a breakdown of the main components:</p>

          <h3>1. Objective of the Post-Incident Activity Stage</h3>
          <p>The primary goal here is to <strong>reflect and learn</strong> from the incident. By understanding the details of what happened, the actions taken, and their outcomes, the organization can strengthen its ability to respond to future incidents. This stage is typically conducted through a meeting where key team members and stakeholders (such as incident responders, security team, IT staff, legal team, etc.) gather to analyze the incident's impact and response effectiveness. The meeting usually takes place <strong>days after the incident</strong> once the incident report is complete.</p>

          <h3>2. Reporting</h3>
          <p>A <strong>final incident report</strong> is created at the end of this stage. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the incident and answers several important questions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>What happened and when?</strong>: Details about the incident timeline, the nature of the attack, and how it unfolded.</li>
            <li><strong>Team performance</strong>: How well did the team respond based on existing plans, playbooks, policies, and procedures? Were the responses effective, or were there any gaps?</li>
            <li><strong>Business involvement</strong>: Did the business respond quickly and provide necessary information? Were there any delays or obstacles that impacted the response?</li>
            <li><strong>Containment and eradication actions</strong>: What specific actions were taken to stop the incident and eliminate the threat?</li>
            <li><strong>Preventive measures</strong>: What steps can be taken to prevent a similar incident from happening in the future?</li>
            <li><strong>Detection and analysis improvements</strong>: What tools or resources are needed to better detect and analyze future incidents?</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Measurable Results</h3>
          <p>By documenting the entire incident response, the report provides valuable metrics that help evaluate the effectiveness of the team and the incident response process. For example, it may provide:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The number of incidents handled</li>
            <li>Time spent per incident</li>
            <li>The actions performed during each incident</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This data can also help identify trends, such as recurring issues or areas that require improvement in the response process.</p>

          <h3>4. Training and Knowledge Sharing</h3>
          <p>The post-incident phase is also an important time to <strong>train new team members</strong>. New hires can learn how experienced team members handled the incident, and what strategies were successful or needed improvement. This knowledge-sharing can help <strong>accelerate their learning</strong> and prepare them for future incidents.</p>

          <h3>5. Reevaluating Plans, Procedures, and Tools</h3>
          <p>During this stage, the organization should <strong>evaluate its internal processes</strong>. This includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Whether the existing plans, playbooks, and procedures need to be updated based on the lessons learned.</li>
            <li>Reviewing the tools and resources used during the incident to identify gaps and assess whether better tools are needed in the future.</li>
            <li>Reassessing the <strong>team’s training</strong>, readiness, and structure. Are there areas where the team could improve its skill set? Are there gaps in knowledge or processes that need to be addressed?</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>6. Legal Considerations</h3>
          <p>In cases where legal action is needed, the incident report will be crucial. It can be used as a reference in legal proceedings and may help assess the <strong>financial and operational impact</strong> of the incident. For example, the report might be used to calculate damages or to determine whether a breach has violated laws or regulations.</p>

        <h3>What Is SIEM?</h3>
        <p>SIEM is a system used to keep computers, networks, and digital data safe by monitoring, managing, and analyzing security events and data. It combines software tools that collect and process security data from different devices like servers, firewalls, and applications. These tools help security teams spot threats quickly, sometimes even before they happen, allowing for faster responses to security incidents. SIEM systems are essential for protecting a company’s digital environment and are a key part of an organization's overall security strategy.</p>

        <h3>The Evolution of SIEM Technology</h3>
        <p>SIEM technology started as two separate concepts—SIM (Security Information Management) and SEM (Security Event Management)—both of which had their own specialized ways of collecting and analyzing security data. In 2005, two analysts combined these technologies to create SIEM, a more comprehensive solution that handles both data collection and event monitoring. SIEM systems today help organizations keep track of and analyze logs and security events from various sources to detect and manage threats more effectively.</p>
        
        <h3>How Does SIEM Work?</h3>
        <p>SIEM systems gather security data from different sources like computers, network devices, and servers. This data is then standardized and organized so that it’s easy to analyze. Security experts use SIEM to look for patterns that could indicate a security issue. When a potential threat is detected, the system sends an alert to the IT security team, who investigate further. SIEM systems are designed to reduce the overwhelming number of alerts that could happen by filtering out less critical issues and focusing on the most urgent threats. Unlike other tools like Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), SIEM collects and processes data from many sources to give a complete view of security events.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Functions of SIEM</h3>

        <h3>>Benefits of Using a SIEM</h3>
        <p>Using SIEM offers several important advantages. It gives security teams a centralized view of all security-related data, allowing them to spot potential threats that may have been missed otherwise. It can also help detect threats before they become full-blown attacks, saving the organization from financial losses and reputational damage. Additionally, SIEM helps businesses comply with legal and regulatory standards, ensuring that logs and security events are properly recorded and monitored.</p>

    <h3>Using Elastic Stack as a SIEM Solution</h3>
    <p>The Elastic Stack is often implemented as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution. It allows for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ingestion of security-related data from sources like firewalls, IDS/IPS, and endpoints using Logstash.</li>
        <li>Storing and indexing security data in Elasticsearch.</li>
        <li>Creating dashboards in Kibana for analyzing and visualizing security events.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Kibana Query Language (KQL)</h3>
    <p><strong>What is KQL?</strong> It is a user-friendly query language for running searches in Kibana. Here’s how it works:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic Structure:</strong> Queries are written in <code>field:value</code> format. Example:
            <div class="terminal">
                <span class="prompt"></span> event.code:4625
            </div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Free Text Search:</strong> Search for terms across fields without specifying a field name. Example:
            <div class="terminal">
                <span class="prompt"></span> "svc-sql1"
            </div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Logical Operators:</strong> Combine conditions using AND, OR, and NOT. Example:
            <div class="terminal">
                <span class="prompt"></span> event.code:4625 AND winlog.event_data.SubStatus:0xC0000072
            </div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Comparison Operators:</strong> Match conditions precisely using <code>:>, :>=, :<, :<=, :!</code>. Example:
            <div class="terminal">
                <span class="prompt"></span> event.code:4625 AND winlog.event_data.SubStatus:0xC0000072 AND @timestamp >= "2023-03-03T00:00:00.000Z" AND @timestamp <= "2023-03-06T23:59:59.999Z"
            </div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Wildcards:</strong> Search using patterns. Example:
            <div class="terminal">
                <span class="prompt"></span> event.code:4625 AND user.name: admin*
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Identify Available Data</h3>
    <p>There are two main approaches:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Using KQL’s Free Text Search:</strong> Explore fields and values using the "Discover" feature in Kibana. For example, searching for <code>"4625"</code> reveals event codes and timestamps.</li>
        <li><strong>Leveraging Elastic Documentation:</strong> Refer to Elastic’s documentation to understand field structures, including:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Elastic Common Schema (ECS)</li>
            <li>Winlogbeat fields</li>
            <li>Filebeat fields</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <h3>Elastic Common Schema (ECS)</h3>
    <p>The Elastic Common Schema standardizes field names across data sources, offering:</p>
    <div class="table-container">
    <table border="1" style="width: 100%;">
        <tr>
            <th>Feature</th>
            <th>Benefit</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Unified Data View</td>
            <td>Allows correlation across multiple sources with consistent field names.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Improved Query Efficiency</td>
            <td>Simplifies query writing in KQL.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Better Visualizations</td>
            <td>Enables seamless dashboard creation.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Advanced Elastic Features</td>
            <td>Integrates well with Elastic’s Security and Observability tools.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </div>

    <p>Using ECS fields ensures consistency, future-proofing, and efficient investigation of cybersecurity incidents.</p>
        
            <h3>What is a SIEM Use Case?</h3>

        <p>A SIEM use case defines specific scenarios or patterns that assist in identifying potential security threats within an organization. These use cases act as practical guidelines, demonstrating how a SIEM system can monitor and respond to different incidents.</p>
        <p>They can range from simple examples, such as monitoring failed login attempts, to more complex cases, like detecting the initial signs of a ransomware attack. By incorporating these use cases into a cybersecurity strategy, organizations can improve their ability to recognize and address security risks effectively.</p>
        <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/211/usecase1.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <h3>SIEM Use Case Development Lifecycle</h3>
        <p>Developing SIEM use cases involves following essential stages to ensure they are effective and align with the organization’s security objectives. These stages provide a structured approach to designing and implementing use cases.</p>
        <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/211/usecase2.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>Understand the purpose of the use case and identify the specific scenario where an alert or notification is necessary. These requirements can come from stakeholders like customers, analysts, or employees. For instance, the objective might be to detect a brute force attack by triggering an alert after 10 failed login attempts within 4 minutes.</p>

        <h3>Data Points</h3>
        <p>Determine all points in the network where a user can log in and identify the data sources generating logs for failed login attempts or unauthorized access. Examples of such sources include Windows systems, Linux servers, applications, and endpoints. Ensure the logs capture key details like user, timestamp, source, and destination.</p>

        <h3>Log Validation</h3>
        <p>Check the logs to ensure they provide all essential information, such as user, timestamp, source, destination, machine name, and application name. Validate that logs are consistently received for various authentication methods, including local, web-based, application, VPN, and OWA (Outlook Web Access).</p>

        <h3>Design and Implementation</h3>
        <p>Once logs are validated, design the use case by specifying the conditions for triggering alerts. Define criteria such as condition, aggregation, and priority. For example, in a brute force scenario, create an alert for 10 login failures in 4 minutes, set aggregation to reduce false positives, and assign a priority based on the importance of the user account.</p>

        <h3>Documentation</h3>
        <p>Create Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) outlining the steps analysts must follow when responding to alerts. Include details about conditions, aggregation rules, priorities, and the teams involved in reporting or escalation. Also, specify the escalation matrix for effective response management.</p>

        <h3>Onboarding</h3>
        <p>Begin testing the alert in a controlled environment before deploying it to production. Identify and address any issues, such as false positives, during the development phase. Once optimized, move the alert into production.</p>

        <h3>Periodic Update and Fine-tuning</h3>
        <p>Regularly gather feedback from analysts and adjust correlation rules as needed. Update and optimize the use case to maintain its accuracy, including steps like whitelisting non-threatening activities to reduce unnecessary alerts.</p>

        <h3>How to Build SIEM Use Cases</h3>

        <p>Understand the organization's specific needs and risks, then configure alerts to monitor critical systems effectively.</p>

        <p>Prioritize alerts based on their potential impact and link them to frameworks like the MITRE ATT&CK or the kill chain to align with adversarial tactics.</p>

        <p>Define the Time to Detection (TTD) and Time to Response (TTR) metrics to evaluate the efficiency of the SIEM system and the performance of security analysts.</p>

        <p>Develop a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to guide analysts in managing and responding to alerts.</p>

        <p>Establish a method for continually improving alerts through insights gained from SIEM monitoring and analysis.</p>

        <p>Create an Incident Response Plan (IRP) to ensure a structured approach for addressing verified threats.</p>

        <p>Set clear Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Operational Level Agreements (OLAs) between teams to handle alerts and execute the IRP effectively.</p>

        <p>Implement regular audits to track alert management and incident reporting, ensuring compliance and reliability.</p>

        <p>Document the logging setup for systems, the rationale behind alert configurations, and the frequency of triggered alerts for review and refinement.</p>

        <p>Maintain a knowledge base with essential details and updates to case management tools, supporting efficient case handling and collaboration.</p>


        <h3> Case scenario: Attackers Exploit MSBuild</h3>
        <p>I would recommend that you read this first: https://tinyurl.com/bypassmsbuild</p>
        <p>To mitigate this risk, we implement a detection rule within our SIEM system to track cases where MSBuild is launched by applications like Excel or Word. This unusual activity might signal the execution of a malicious script payload.</p>
        <p>To mitigate this risk, we design a detection rule in our SIEM system that keeps track of instances where MSBuild is launched by Excel or Word. This activity is unusual and might suggest the execution of a malicious script payload.</p>
        <p>Based on the identified risk and threat intelligence, the technique referred to as Living-off-the-land binaries (LoLBins) presents a significant security concern if detected. This makes it a high global risk, and we assign it a HIGH severity rating. However, this severity may vary depending on your organization's specific context and environment.</p>

        <p>Regarding MITRE mapping, this use case involves bypassing detection mechanisms using LoLBins, which can be broken down as follows:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tactic:</strong> Defense Evasion (TA0005)</li>
          <li><strong>Technique:</strong> Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution (T1127)</li>
          <li><strong>Sub-technique:</strong> Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution: MSBuild (T1127.001)</li>
          <li><strong>Tactic:</strong> Execution (TA0002) – when MSBuild is executed on the endpoint</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To establish TTD (Time to Detect) and TTR (Time to Respond), we need to consider the execution frequency of the rule and the process for ingesting data, as previously mentioned. In this case, the rule is set to run every five minutes, continuously monitoring all incoming log data.</p>

        <p>When creating a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and outlining how to handle alerts, it’s important to focus on these key elements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>process.name</strong></li>
          <li><strong>process.parent.name</strong></li>
          <li><strong>event.action</strong></li>
          <li><strong>machine</strong> where the alert was triggered</li>
          <li><strong>user</strong> associated with the machine</li>
          <li><strong>user activity</strong> within a two-day window before or after the alert</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After collecting this information, the next step is to engage with the user and investigate their machine. This includes reviewing system logs, antivirus logs, and proxy logs from the SIEM to ensure full visibility of the situation. The SOC team should carefully document all these details, including the Incident Response Plan, so that Incident Handlers can easily refer to them during the analysis process.</p>

        <p>When refining detection rules, it's crucial to understand scenarios that may result in false positives. For example, while the Build Engine is frequently used by Windows developers, it is less common for non-developers to use it. Therefore, excluding known legitimate parent process names from the rule can help minimize false alerts.</p>

      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Cloud computing refers to accessing and using computing resources over the internet rather than relying on local servers or physical hardware. These resources include things like virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. The cloud also offers advanced services such as Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI), which go beyond the traditional IT setup. Since cloud computing operates over the internet, it’s not limited by physical infrastructure like a traditional data center. This means that businesses can quickly scale up their IT resources without the need to build new data centers. They can just tap into the cloud to expand their operations on demand.</p>

      <div class="solution-section" id="solution-room9" style="display: none;">
          <img src="cloudcomputer.jpg" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p><strong>1: What is cloud computing?</strong> Cloud computing is like having a computer, but instead of buying one and storing it yourself, you access it over the internet. It offers more advanced features compared to owning a physical computer. It's similar to owning a computer at home, but with cloud computing, you can access it from anywhere, For example, if you're running a commercial website from your own computer, you'll likely have databases and resources running on that computer. As your website grows, you may run into problems like running out of storage or overloading your computer. This can cause issues like downtime or slow performance, That's where cloud computing comes in. With cloud computing, you don't need to worry about these limitations. The cloud provides more storage and resources when you need them, and the maintenance, backups, and updates are handled by other people. This makes it easier for businesses to scale and focus on their work without worrying about technical problems.</p>

          <p><strong>2: shared responsibility model </strong> In a traditional corporate data center, the company handles everything—maintaining the physical space, ensuring security, and taking care of the servers. The IT team is in charge of keeping all systems updated, patched, and running smoothly, With the shared responsibility model in cloud computing, the duties are split between the cloud provider and the customer. The provider manages the physical aspects, such as security, power, cooling, and network connectivity, since the customer isn't on-site with the data center, The customer, however, is responsible for the data stored in the cloud. They must ensure that their information is secure and accessible only to authorized users. For example, while the cloud provider may handle a cloud SQL database, the customer still owns the data in it and must manage who has access, Some responsibilities are dependent on the specific service. For instance, if you’re using a cloud database service (PaaS), the provider handles the maintenance of the database, but the customer remains responsible for managing the data. However, if the customer sets up their own virtual machine and installs a database (IaaS), they’re responsible for both the database and the data within it, In a physical data center, the company owns all responsibilities, but with cloud computing, the shared responsibility model varies depending on the type of service—whether it's Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS places more responsibility on the consumer, while SaaS puts most of the burden on the provider. PaaS is a middle ground, where the responsibilities are more evenly distributed.</p>
          <p><strong>Info:</strong> This diagram highlights how the Shared Responsibility Model informs who is responsible for what.</p>
          <img src="diagramshareres.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>You’ll always be responsible for:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>The information and data stored in the cloud</li>
                <li>Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)</li>
                <li>The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>The cloud provider is always responsible for:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>The physical datacenter</li>
                <li>The physical network</li>

          <h3>cloud models</h3>
          <img src="pubicprivatebriate.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">  
          <p> Private Cloud: A private cloud is similar to a corporate datacenter but with the added benefit of cloud technologies. It's a cloud service dedicated to a single organization, offering more control for the company's IT team. However, private clouds are often more expensive and do not offer the same scalability or flexibility as public clouds. A private cloud can be hosted within your own data center or in a dedicated offsite facility, potentially managed by a third-party.</p>
          <p> Public Cloud: A public cloud is owned and operated by a third-party provider, making cloud services available to anyone who wants to use them. These clouds are accessible to the general public, which sets them apart from private clouds. Public clouds are typically more cost-effective and offer greater scalability, but users have less control over the infrastructure.</p>
          <p> Hybrid Cloud: A hybrid cloud combines both private and public clouds, enabling seamless integration between the two. This setup allows businesses to scale their private cloud with public cloud resources during peak demand. It also provides flexibility, letting organizations choose which workloads should stay in the private cloud for added security and which can move to the public cloud for cost efficiency.</p>
          <img src="multi-cloudand more.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p>Multi-cloud: In a multi-cloud setup, a company utilizes multiple cloud providers, often combining different services from each one. This can happen if the company uses features from several providers or is transitioning from one to another. The main idea is managing resources and security across two or more public cloud environments, giving businesses more flexibility and options for their cloud services.</p>
          <p>Azure Arc: Azure Arc is a set of tools that help you manage and oversee your cloud resources, whether they are in a public cloud (like Azure), a private cloud in your own data center, a hybrid setup, or a multi-cloud environment with resources spread across different providers. It simplifies managing various cloud configurations from a single interface.</p>
          <p>Azure VMware Solution: If you're already using VMware in a private cloud but want to take advantage of the scalability and flexibility of public or hybrid clouds, Azure VMware Solution allows you to run your VMware-based workloads in Azure. It integrates VMware seamlessly with Azure, making it easier to scale and manage workloads in the cloud.</p>
          <h3>consumption-based model</h3>
          <img src="datacomu.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p>When comparing IT infrastructure models, there are two main types of costs to consider: CapEx and OpEx. CapEx is a one-time investment made to acquire or establish physical assets, such as purchasing land, constructing buildings, or setting up a data center. It's a large, upfront expenditure that results in ownership of the resources. In contrast, OpEx involves ongoing, recurring expenses for services or products. This includes costs like renting space, leasing equipment, or subscribing to cloud services. With OpEx, you pay for the use of something over time rather than owning it outright. Cloud computing follows the OpEx model because it’s based on how much you use. Instead of investing in physical infrastructure and managing it, you only pay for the cloud resources you consume, which can vary month to month depending on your needs. If you don’t use any services, there’s no cost for that period.</p>
          <p>This consumption-based model has many benefits, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>No upfront costs.</li>
            <li>No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.</li>
            <li>The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.</li>
            <li>The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In a traditional data center, you have to estimate how much resources you'll need in the future. If you overestimate, you'll end up spending more money than necessary on hardware that isn't fully used. If you underestimate, your data center may quickly run out of capacity, causing performance issues for your applications and services. Fixing this usually involves ordering and installing new hardware, along with adding power, cooling, and networking, which can be time-consuming.</p>
          <p>With cloud computing, you don’t need to worry about getting your resource needs exactly right. If you need more virtual machines, you can add them easily. If the demand drops, you can remove them just as easily. You only pay for the virtual machines you use, so there's no need to worry about paying for unused "extra capacity" that cloud providers keep available.</p>
          <p>Cloud computing involves accessing computing resources, like storage, processing power, and software, over the internet, rather than relying on local infrastructure. It uses a pay-as-you-go model, meaning you only pay for the services you actually use. This approach helps you:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Plan and manage your operating costs.</li>
            <li>Run your infrastructure more efficiently.</li>
            <li>Scale as your business needs change.</li>
          </ul>

      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Dashboards in SIEM systems act as frameworks that hold various visualizations, enabling us to structure and present data in an insightful and organized manner.</p>

      <div class="solution-section" id="solution-room12" style="display: none;">
        <h3>1. Create a new Dashboard</h3>
        <img src="newdashboardsiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <h3>2. Create a new visualization.</h3>
        <img src="newvisualization.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p>When we begin creating our first visualization, a new window will open, offering various options and settings to choose from.</p>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong>Before configuring anything, we should first click the calendar icon to access the time picker. Next, we need to set the date range to "last 15 years." Once that's done, we can click the "Apply" button to apply the selected date range to the data.</p>
        <img src="befosiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/211/visualization1.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p>This window offers <strong>four key elements</strong> to explore. One of the most important features is the <strong>filtering option</strong>, which allows us to refine the data before creating a graph.</p>

        <ul>
          <img src="filsiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p>For example, if we want to focus on failed login attempts, we can set a filter to include only events with the specific ID <strong>4625</strong>, which represents failed logon attempts on a Windows system. The image below demonstrates how such a filter can be applied.</p>
          <li><strong>1. Filtering option:</strong> Customize the data to match specific criteria before visualization.</li>
          <li>Focus on event ID <strong>4625</strong> for failed logon attempts.</li>
        </ul>
        

        <img src="windotab2siemp.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

        <p>This field represents the <strong>data set (index)</strong> that will be used. Typically, data from various infrastructure sources is organized into separate indices, such as <strong>network</strong>, <strong>Windows</strong>, or <strong>Linux</strong>.</p>

        <p>In this example, we will define <strong>windows*</strong> as the value for the "Index pattern" to focus specifically on Windows-related data.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Select the appropriate data set to analyze.</li>
          <li><strong>Example:</strong> Use <code>windows*</code> to capture data from Windows systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="usesiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p>The <strong>search bar</strong> enables us to verify the presence of a specific field within our data set, acting as a helpful tool to ensure we're analyzing the correct data.</p>

        <p>For instance, if we are interested in the <code>user.name.keyword</code> field, we can use the search bar to check if this field exists and has been detected in the selected data set. This process confirms that we are accessing the right field and working with precise data.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Function:</strong> Double-check the availability of specific fields.</li>
          <li><strong>Example:</strong> Search for <code>user.name.keyword</code> to verify its existence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why use </p>
        <div class="terminal">
          <span class="prompt"></span> user.name.keyword
        </div>
        <p>instead of</p> 
        <div class="terminal">
          <span class="prompt">$</span> user.name
        </div>
          <p>You might wonder. The answer lies in how <strong>aggregations</strong> work. When performing aggregations, it is recommended to use the <code>.keyword</code> version of the field.</p>

          <p>For a more detailed explanation, you can check out this related discussion on Stack Overflow. https://tinyurl.com/aggregationssiem</p>

          <p>The Stack Overflow discussion explores the difference between <strong>fields</strong> and the <span class="keyword">Field</span> class in Java. Here's a brief explanation:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fields:</strong> These are variables declared within a class, used to store data. They can be primitive types (e.g., <span class="keyword">int</span>, <span class="keyword">boolean</span>) or reference types (e.g., objects of other classes).</li>
            <li><strong><span class="keyword">Field</span> class:</strong> Java doesn't have a "Field" keyword, but it includes a <span class="keyword">Field</span> class in the <span class="keyword">java.lang.reflect</span> package. This class is part of Java's reflection API and allows dynamic inspection and modification of class fields at runtime.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The key distinction is that <strong>fields</strong> are fundamental components of a class, while the <span class="keyword">Field</span> class is a specialized tool for performing runtime operations like accessing or altering fields dynamically.</p>
          <p><strong>For Example:</strong></p>
          <div class="terminal">
            <span class="prompt">$</span> some_field
          </div>
          <p>and</p>
          <div class="terminal">
            <span class="prompt">$</span> some_field.keyword
          </div>
          <p>Another interesting read would be this link: https://tinyurl.com/Textvskeyword</p>
          <p>Finally, this <strong>drop-down menu</strong> lets us choose the type of visualization we want to create. The default option shown in the previous image is <span class="keyword">"Bar vertical stacked"</span>.</p>

          <p>Clicking on this button will reveal additional options (the image has been redacted as not all options are visible on the screen). From this expanded list, we can select the visualization type that best suits our needs and data presentation goals.</p>
          <img src="bar4.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p>For this visualization, we will pick the <span class="keyword">"Table"</span> option. Once we've selected <span class="keyword">"Table"</span>, the next step is to click on the <span class="keyword">"Rows"</span> option.</p>

          <p>This allows us to specify which data elements we want to display within the table format.</p>
          <img src="tablsiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p>Let's configure the "Rows" settings as follows.</p>
          <img src="rowinsiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> You might see "Rank by Alphabetical" instead of "Rank by Count of records" as shown in the earlier screenshot. This is completely fine. Once you proceed with the next configuration, the option to rank by "Count of records" will become available.</p>
          <p>in the "Metrics" window, let's select "count" as the desired metric.</p>
          <img src="countmetrisiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p>Once we choose "Count" as the metric, we will see the table fill with data, provided there are events available in the selected data set.</p>
          <img src="visualizationsiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p>The last step in customizing the table is to add another "Rows" setting to display the machine where the failed logon attempt took place. To achieve this, we will choose the <span class="keyword">host.hostname.keyword</span> field, which indicates the computer that logged the failed attempt. This will enable us to show the hostname or machine name alongside the count of failed logon attempts, as demonstrated in the image.</p>
          <img src="newrowsiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p>Now, the table displays three columns with the following details:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The usernames of individuals attempting to log in (Note: Currently, both user and computer accounts are shown. Ideally, a filter should be applied to exclude computers and display only users).</li>
            <li>The machine where the logon attempt took place.</li>
            <li>The count of how many times the event occurred, based on the selected time frame or the entire data set, depending on the configuration.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Finally, click on <span class="keyword">"Save and return"</span>, and you’ll see the new visualization added to the dashboard, as illustrated in the next image.</p>
          <img src="savenadreturnsiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p>Let's not forget to save the dashboard as well. We can do so by simply clicking on the "Save" button.</p>
          <img src="myfirstdashboardsiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <img src="dashbaordsiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <h3>let's refine the visualization</h3>
          <img src="refininigsiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p>Let's now click on the "gear" button at the upper-right corner of our visualization, and then click on "Edit lens".</p>
          <img src="editeamssiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p>Top values of user.name.keyword" should be changed as follows</p>
          <img src="valueunersiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <img src="chaningsiemrow.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p>Top values of host.hostname.keyword" should be changed as follows</p>
          <img src="chanignseconrow.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p>The "Logon Type" can be added as follows (we will use the winlog.logon.type.keyword field)</p>
          <img src="newrowlog.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p>Count of records" should be changed as follows.</p>
          <img src="chngingmetrixsiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p>We can introduce result sorting as follows</p>
          <img src="sortsiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p>All we have to do now is click on "Save and return"</p>
          <p><strong>The DESKTOP-DPOESND, WIN-OK9BH1BCKSD, and WIN-RMMGJA7T9TC</strong> usernames can be excluded by specifying additional filters as follows.</p>
          <img src="filterout.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <img src="filteroutcomplete.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p>Computer accounts can be excluded by specifying the following KQL query and clicking on the "Update" button</p>
          <div class="terminal">
            <span class="prompt">$</span> NOT user.name: *$ AND winlog.channel.keyword: Security
          </div>
          <p>The AND <strong>winlog.channel.keyword: Security</strong> part is to ensure that no unrelated logs are accounted for.</p>
          <img src="rulefilterinsiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p>This is our visualization after all the refinements we performed.</p>
          <p>Finally, let's give our visualization a title by clicking on "No Title"</p>
          <img src="titleforsiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p>Don't forget to click on the "Save" button (the one on the upper-right hand side of the window)</p>
          <h3>Failed Logon Attempts (Disabled Users)</h3>
        <p>A prebaked dashboard should be visible. Let's click on the "pencil"/edit icon.</p>
        <img src="editdasiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p>To start building our first visualization, just click the "Create visualization" button.</p>
        <img src="createnewvisualizasiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p>When you begin creating your first visualization, a new window will open, presenting a range of options and settings for customization.</p>
        <img src="newvisusiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p>In this window, there are four key elements to focus on:</p>
        <ul>
          <img src="disabledusers.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <li><strong>1:</strong> A filter option that lets us narrow down the data before generating a graph. For instance, our goal here is to showcase failed logon attempts specifically targeting disabled users. To achieve this, we can set up a filter that includes event IDs corresponding to 4625—representing failed logon attempts on Windows systems, similar to what we did in the previous visualization. However, in this scenario, we also need to factor in the SubStatus field (winlog.event_data.SubStatus), which should be set to 0xC0000072 to indicate that the logon failure is due to a disabled user. The image below illustrates how to configure this filter.</li>
          <img src="windowsbarsiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <li><Strong>2:</Strong> This field determines the dataset, or index, that will be utilized. Data from different infrastructure components is often organized into distinct indices, such as those for network activity, Windows systems, Linux systems, and so on. For this example, we’ll define windows* in the "Index pattern" to focus on Windows-related data.</li> 
          <img src="searchbar.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <li><Strong>3:</Strong> The search bar allows us to verify whether a specific field exists within our dataset. It serves as a useful tool to ensure we're examining the right data. For instance, similar to the previous visualization, we are focused on the user.name.keyword field. By using the search bar, we can quickly check if this field is available and identified within the chosen dataset. This step helps confirm that we're accessing the correct field and working with reliable data.</li>
          <img src="barverticalsiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <li><strong>4:</strong> Finally, this drop-down menu allows us to choose the type of visualization we wish to create. The default setting, as shown earlier, is "Bar vertical stacked." By clicking on this menu, a list of additional visualization options will appear (not fully shown in the image due to screen size). From this list, we can select the visualization style that best matches our data and presentation goals.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We’ll begin by choosing the "Table" option. Once it’s selected, we can move on to click the "Rows" option. This step enables us to specify the particular data elements we want to display in the table view.</p>
        <p>Let's configure the "Rows" settings as follows.</p>
        <img src="editingrowinsiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <img src="chaningcount.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p>To enhance the table further, we can add another "Rows" setting to display the machine where the failed logon attempt took place. For this, we’ll select the host.hostname.keyword field, which identifies the computer that reported the failed logon. This addition will let us show the hostname or machine name alongside the number of failed logon attempts.</p>
        <img src="nerowsiem.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p>The table now displays three columns, each providing the following details:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The disabled user whose credentials triggered the failed logon attempt.</li>
          <li>The machine where the logon attempt was made.</li>
          <li>The frequency of these events, calculated based on the selected time frame or the entire dataset, depending on the configuration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To finish, click on "Save and return," and you’ll see the newly created visualization added to the dashboard.</p>
        <p><Strong>1:</Strong> What is the logon type indicated in the returned document for failed logon attempts involving disabled users?</p>
        <p>I would add the search field name to the row: <Strong>winlog.logon.type.keyword</Strong></p>
        <p><Strong>2:</Strong> What should you specify after user.name: in the KQL query to include failed logon attempt data where the username field contains the keyword "admin" anywhere within it?</p>
        <p>I would add this KQL query: <strong>user.name: *admin*</strong></p>

          <h3>Variables</h3>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong>A variable lets you store a value by assigning it to a name.</p>
          <p>Each variable has a specific category, called its type, that determines what kind of data it can store. For example, a variable might store words or text, whole numbers, decimal values, or other kinds of information.</p>
          <p>For Example</p>
          <div class="ide-terminal">
            <div class="ide-prompt">C</div>
            <div class="ide-code">
              <span class="keyword">int</span> level; 
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>The <strong>int</strong> type is used to store whole numbers, which are numbers without any fractional or decimal parts. In programming, these are commonly referred to as integers.</p>
          <p>Once we declare a variable, we can give it a value by using the = symbol, which is called the assignment operator.</p>
          <div class="ide-terminal">
            <div class="ide-prompt">C</div>
            <div class="ide-code">
              <span class="keyword">int</span> level; 
              <span class="keyword">level = </span>204;
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>We can display or print the value stored in our variable.</p>
          <div class="ide-terminal">
            <div class="ide-prompt">C</div>
            <div class="ide-code">
              <span class="keyword">#include</span> &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br>
              <span class="keyword">int</span> main() {
                  <span class="string">int </span>= level
                  <span class="keyword">level = </span>, <span class="number">204</span><br>
                  <span class="keyword">printf</span>(<span class="string">"%d"</span>, <span class="keyword">level</span>);<br>
                  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="number">0</span>;<br>
              }<br>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>We used the <strong>%d</strong> format specifier because score is an integer. The <strong>printf</strong> function then replaces <strong>%d</strong> with the value of score when displaying the output.</p>
          <p>We can declare a variable and assign it a value at the same time, like this:</p>
          <div class="ide-terminal">
            <div class="ide-prompt">C</div>
            <div class="ide-code">
              <span class="keyword">#include</span> &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br>
              <span class="keyword">int</span> main() {
                  <span class="string">int </span>level = <span class="number">204</span><br>
                  <span class="keyword">printf</span>(<span class="string">"%d"</span>, <span class="keyword">level</span>);<br>
                  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="number">0</span>;<br>
              }<br>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>The value of a variable can be updated or changed multiple times while the program is running.</p>
          <div class="ide-terminal">
            <div class="ide-prompt">C</div>
            <div class="ide-code">
              <span class="keyword">#include</span> &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br>
              <span class="keyword">int</span> main() {
                  <span class="string">int </span>level = <span class="number">204</span>
                  <span class="keyword">level =</span> <span class="number">404</span>
                  <span class="keyword">printf</span>(<span class="string">"%d"</span>, <span class="keyword">level</span>);<br>
                  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="number">0</span>;<br>
              }<br>

      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Generative AI is a fascinating branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating content, such as text, images, music, or even videos. Understanding its fundamentals involves delving into concepts like machine learning, neural networks, and probability models.</p>

      <div class="solution-section" id="solution-room14" style="display: none;">
          <h3>language models</h3>
          <p>Generative AI runs on the magic of language models—specialized machine learning systems designed to understand and create human-like language. These models are the backbone of many tasks in natural language processing (NLP), such as:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Analyzing Sentiment:</strong> Figuring out the tone or mood behind a piece of text, like identifying whether a review is positive or negative.</li>
            <li><strong>Summarizing Content:</strong> Boiling down lengthy text into its most important points, making it easier to digest large amounts of information.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparing Meaning:</strong> Checking how similar the ideas in different texts are, which is useful for tasks like plagiarism detection or matching user queries with relevant documents.</li>
            <li><strong>Creating New Text:</strong> Writing original content that feels natural and human, such as generating articles, emails, or even dialogue for chatbots.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>What makes these models so powerful is their ability to learn patterns and structures in language from vast amounts of data. They can understand context, adapt to various tasks, and even get better with fine-tuning for specific applications. While the underlying mathematics can be complex, you can build a strong understanding by focusing on their architecture and how they use training data to generate outputs.</p>
          
          <h3>Transformer models</h3>
          <p>Modern large language models leverage the transformer architecture, a revolutionary design that has reshaped how machines process and generate human language. Transformers enhance earlier methods by focusing on the relationships between words, enabling them to excel in tasks like generating meaningful, context-aware text. By training on massive datasets, these models learn to identify patterns, semantics, and the flow of natural language, allowing them to produce outputs that are often indistinguishable from human writing.</p>

          <p>The architecture of transformers is built on two core components:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Encoder Block:</strong> This component processes the input text and converts it into a detailed semantic representation. It captures the context and meaning of the text, making it easier for the model to understand complex language structures.</li>
            <li><strong>Decoder Block:</strong> Using the encoded information, this component generates new text sequences by predicting the next word or phrase, ensuring the output aligns with the input's context and style.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>What makes transformers particularly powerful is their ability to handle large-scale parallel computations. Unlike earlier models, they use a mechanism called <strong>self-attention</strong>, which allows them to focus on relevant parts of the input while generating responses. This capability not only boosts their efficiency but also makes them highly adaptable to a wide range of NLP tasks, from summarization and question-answering to translation and creative writing.</p>

          <p>As these models continue to evolve, they are becoming even better at understanding nuanced language, cultural references, and user intent, further blurring the lines between human and machine communication.</p>
          <img src="enocder_decoderai.png" alt="Room 1 Demonstration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p>This diagram illustrates the process of how a transformer-based model processes and generates text. Let me explain the steps shown in the image:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Input Documents (Step 1):</strong> The process starts with input documents or text data. This could be a sentence or a collection of text, which the model will process to generate a meaningful output.</li>
            <li><strong>Encoder (Step 2):</strong> The encoder block takes the input data (text) and converts it into a semantic representation. It breaks down the text and captures the relationships between words, creating a vector representation for each word or token (e.g., "dog", "cat", "puppy"). These representations help the model understand the meaning and context of the words in the input.</li>
            <li><strong>Semantic Representation (Step 3):</strong> The encoder outputs a set of vectors representing the words and their relationships in the text. In the diagram, these vectors are associated with words like "dog", "cat", and "puppy", each having a vector representation (e.g., [10, 3, 2] for "dog").</li>
            <li><strong>Decoder (Step 4):</strong> The decoder block takes the semantic representations from the encoder and generates the output text. The decoder uses the encoded information to predict the next word or token in the sequence, generating text step by step.</li>
            <li><strong>Output Text (Step 5):</strong> Finally, the decoder produces the output text, which is a continuation or transformation of the original input. In this case, the output is "… a puppy", which is the model's generated text based on the input "When my dog was…".</li>
          </ol>

          <p>In essence, the encoder processes the input and creates a representation of its meaning, while the decoder uses that representation to generate new text that logically follows from the input. This is how transformer models are able to handle tasks like translation, text generation, and more.</p>
          <p>In real-world applications, different versions of the transformer architecture are tailored to meet specific needs. For instance, Google's <strong>Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)</strong> model, designed to enhance search engine performance, relies solely on the encoder block. BERT is optimized for understanding context from both directions—left and right—of a given word in a sentence, which makes it excellent for tasks like question answering and sentence classification.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, OpenAI's <strong>Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)</strong> model focuses on generating human-like text and uses only the decoder block. This setup allows GPT to generate text sequentially, predicting the next word based on the context provided by the previous words. While both models are based on transformers, their different architectures reflect their specialized purposes: BERT for understanding text and GPT for generating text.</p>
          <p>This flexibility in transformer architectures enables them to be adapted for various tasks, whether it's analyzing text for deeper meaning or producing coherent and creative outputs.</p>
          
          <h3>Tokenization</h3>
          <p>Tokenization is the initial process when training a transformer model. It involves breaking down the input text into smaller units known as tokens. Essentially, this step identifies each distinct value or component within the text. For simplicity's sake, you can think of a token as being a unique word in the text. However, in practice, tokens can also represent parts of words, whole phrases, or even combinations of words and punctuation marks.</p>
          <p>This step is crucial because it converts raw text into manageable units that the model can process. By splitting the text into tokens, the model can understand and analyze individual pieces of information, enabling it to learn patterns and relationships between words, parts of words, and other language features.</p>
          <p>Let's take a different example to explain tokenization. Consider the sentence:</p>

          <p><em>She enjoys reading books in the library every afternoon.</em></p>

          <p>To tokenize this sentence, we break it down into smaller, meaningful units (tokens). Each distinct word or component is assigned a unique identifier. For instance:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>She (1)</li>
            <li>enjoys (2)</li>
            <li>reading (3)</li>
            <li>books (4)</li>
            <li>in (5)</li>
            <li>the (6)</li>
            <li>library (7)</li>
            <li>every (8)</li>
            <li>afternoon (9)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In this example, we assign a unique token ID to each word. This allows the transformer model to process the text step by step, learning the relationships between these words. While tokenization here involves straightforward words, in more advanced cases, it might include subword units, punctuation marks, or even whole phrases to better capture language nuances.</p>
