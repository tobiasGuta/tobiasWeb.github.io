            <h2>bypassing-php-whitelist-validation</h2>
            <p>This tool is a Bash script designed to facilitate the creation of wordlists tailored for upload attacks targeting web applications. It systematically generates a list of filenames incorporating various characters and common PHP file extensions. By iterating through different combinations of characters such as spaces, newlines, null bytes, carriage returns, slashes, dots, colons, and ellipses, and appending or prepending them to typical PHP file extensions, the script generates a comprehensive wordlist. Each generated filename represents a potential vector for upload-based attacks, helping security researchers and penetration testers assess and fortify the resilience of web applications against such threats.</p>

            <h2>StealthCommand</h2>
            <p>This script creates a simple TCP server that enables remote command execution. Clients can connect to the server, send commands, and receive the output. Running as a daemon in the background, it operates discreetly and can handle multiple client connections at once. This makes it suitable for tasks like remote administration, and pentesting as it runs silently without user interaction, hiding its output. It also forks the process to ensure it stays active even if the user closes the terminal. The use of threads allows the server to handle multiple clients concurrently, improving scalability, by leveraging the setproctitle module, the script can rename the process, making it harder to detect in system process lists.</p>
