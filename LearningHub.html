        <h3>The OSI Model and Its Security Concerns</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
            <p>This is my undertanding of the OSI model</p>
            <p>The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework that standardizes how network devices communicate. It has seven layers, each serving a specific role in data transmission.</p>
            
            
            <!-- Adding an Image -->
            <img src="osi.png" alt="OSI Model Layers" style="width: 100%; max-width: 1650px; border-radius: 10px;">

            <h4>Comparison of the OSI Model and TCP/IP Model</h4>
            <img src="osiandtcpmodel.png" alt="OSI Model Layers" style="width: 100%; max-width: 1650px; border-radius: 10px;">
            
            <h4>Network Protocols</h4>
        <p>Protocols are predefined rules that govern how data is formatted, transmitted, and processed to enable seamless communication between devices in a network. These protocols function across various layers within network models, each designed to manage specific data types and communication requirements.</p>

        <h4>Key Network Protocols</h4>
        <p>Network protocols define the rules for data exchange across networks, ensuring efficient and structured communication. Each protocol operates at a specific layer of the OSI model, managing different aspects of data transmission.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the TCP/IP Model</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
            <img src="tcpIP.png" alt="OSI Model Layers" style="width: 30%; max-width: 1650px; border-radius: 10px;">
            <p>So, we’ve all heard about the <strong>TCP/IP Model</strong>, but what exactly is it, and why should we care about it? Well, it’s basically the backbone of how the internet works. Without it, you wouldn’t be able to binge-watch Netflix, scroll through Instagram, or even check your email!</p>
    
            <h4>What is the TCP/IP Model?</h4>
            <p>The TCP/IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a set of communication protocols that define how data is transmitted over a network. It's a more practical, real-world model than the OSI model and is the foundation for the internet and most networks.</p>
    
            <h4>Why do we need it?</h4>
            <p>Well, every time you send a message, share a file, or visit a website, data is passed between devices using the TCP/IP model. It’s like the secret sauce that makes everything connect, and without it, the internet wouldn’t even exist in the way we know it today.</p>
    
            <h4>The Four Layers of the TCP/IP Model</h4>
            <p>The TCP/IP model has <strong>4 layers</strong>, and each one is crucial in making sure data gets from point A to point B smoothly:</p>
    
            <h4>1. Link Layer</h4>
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This layer is all about the physical connection. It’s responsible for the hardware that sends and receives data – think Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi, and the devices that connect to the network. It’s like the roads and highways that connect cities. The Link Layer corresponds to the Physical and Data Link Layers of the OSI model, covering everything from the physical connection to data framing.</p>
            
            <h4>2. Internet Layer</h4>
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This is where things get interesting. The Internet layer is responsible for routing and addressing. The most famous protocol here is IP (Internet Protocol), which uses IP addresses to figure out where data needs to go. It’s like the GPS system of the internet. This layer corresponds to the Network Layer in the OSI model.</p>
    
            <h4>3. Transport Layer</h4>
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> The transport layer ensures that the data gets to its destination safely and intact. This is where TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) comes in. It makes sure the data is delivered reliably, no matter how many stops it makes along the way. If something goes wrong, it’ll ask for a resend. Think of it like a mailman who double-checks that your package gets delivered correctly. This layer ensures that data packets are delivered in a sequential and error-free manner, corresponding to the Transport Layer of the OSI model.</p>
    
            <h4>4. Application Layer</h4>
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This is the layer that we, as users, interact with. The application layer includes all the protocols that help us use services like HTTP for web browsing, SMTP for sending emails, and FTP for transferring files. It’s what makes the internet usable for us. Without this layer, we wouldn’t have the web, email, or apps! This layer corresponds to the top three layers of the OSI model (Session, Presentation, and Application), providing interfaces and protocols necessary for data exchange between systems.</p>
    
            <h4>Real-Life Example</h4>
            <p>Imagine you’re sending an email. Here’s how the TCP/IP layers help out:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Network Interface: Your computer physically connects to the network.</li>
                <li>Internet: The email gets a destination address (IP address) and is routed through the internet.</li>
                <li>Transport: TCP ensures that the email arrives without errors and is complete.</li>
                <li>Application: The email reaches the email server, and you see it in your inbox.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When conducting penetration testing, it's essential to understand the TCP/IP model, as each layer has its own set of vulnerabilities. Here’s an example of a penetration test that targets each layer of the TCP/IP model, followed by the best defense strategies for each layer.</p>

        <h4>Layer 1: Network Interface Layer - ARP Spoofing</h4>
        <p><strong>Penetration Testing:</strong> At the Network Interface Layer, an attacker can perform ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) spoofing, also known as <strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)</strong> attacks. This attack allows the attacker to intercept data being sent over the local network by poisoning the ARP cache, causing traffic to be sent to the attacker instead of the intended recipient.</p>

        <h4>Defense Strategy:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Static ARP Entries:</strong> Use static ARP entries for critical devices (routers, servers) to prevent ARP poisoning.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong> Use VLANs to segment sensitive network traffic and minimize exposure to local attackers.</li>
            <li><strong>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):</strong> Implement IDS to detect unusual network traffic and ARP spoofing attempts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Layer 2: Internet Layer - IP Spoofing</h4>
        <p><strong>Penetration Testing:</strong> In the Internet Layer, attackers can spoof IP addresses to disguise the origin of their traffic. This can be used for attacks like <strong>Denial of Service (DoS)</strong> or <strong>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)</strong> by flooding the target server with fake requests, making it difficult to trace the real attacker.</p>

        <h4>Defense Strategy:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ingress/Egress Filtering:</strong> Implement filtering on routers/firewalls to ensure only legitimate IP addresses are allowed to communicate.</li>
            <li><strong>Rate Limiting:</strong> Set rate limits on incoming traffic to prevent overwhelming servers with traffic from spoofed IP addresses.</li>
            <li><strong>Anti-Spoofing Configurations:</strong> Configure anti-spoofing rules on the router to check that the source IP matches the expected IP range.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Layer 3: Transport Layer - TCP SYN Flood</h4>
        <p><strong>Penetration Testing:</strong> The Transport Layer is where attackers often launch <strong>SYN Flood</strong> attacks. In this attack, the attacker sends a flood of TCP/SYN requests, causing the target machine to allocate resources and wait for the final acknowledgment, which never comes. This leads to a resource exhaustion and denial of service.</p>

        <h4>Defense Strategy:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flood Protection (SYN Cookies):</strong> Implement SYN cookies or SYN cache to handle incomplete TCP connections and prevent resource exhaustion.</li>
            <li><strong>Firewall Filtering:</strong> Use firewalls to detect and block high volumes of SYN packets from single or multiple sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Rate Limiting:</strong> Rate limit incoming connections to prevent an excessive number of requests from consuming resources.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Layer 4: Application Layer - HTTP Flood Attack</h4>
        <p><strong>Penetration Testing:</strong> At the Application Layer, attackers can flood a web server with HTTP requests to perform a <strong>DoS</strong> attack. This consumes server resources, potentially causing the site to crash or become slow. This is common in <strong>Layer 7 DDoS attacks</strong> targeting web applications.</p>

        <h4>Defense Strategy:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Web Application Firewall (WAF):</strong> Use a WAF to filter and block malicious HTTP requests that are part of a DDoS attack.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Delivery Network (CDN):</strong> Use a CDN to distribute traffic and mitigate the impact of DDoS attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>Rate Limiting & CAPTCHAs:</strong> Implement rate limiting and CAPTCHAs on the application layer to prevent automated attacks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Real-World Penetration Test Example</h4>
        <p>Let’s say you’re testing a web application for vulnerabilities. Here’s how the penetration test might go:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Network Interface:</strong> You could start by sniffing the network with tools like Wireshark and attempt ARP spoofing to capture sensitive data between clients and the server.</li>
            <li><strong>Internet Layer:</strong> Next, you may try IP spoofing to confuse the server or perform DDoS testing by flooding it with malicious packets.</li>
            <li><strong>Transport Layer:</strong> Using a tool like LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon), you might simulate a SYN flood attack to exhaust the server's resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Application Layer:</strong> Finally, you could use a tool like Hydra to brute-force login forms, or perform an HTTP flood using LOIC to check the server's resilience against DDoS attacks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Defensive Measures Summary:</h4>
        <p>Penetration testing helps us identify vulnerabilities, but it’s crucial to implement the right defenses at each layer of the TCP/IP model:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Network Interface Layer:</strong> Static ARP entries, network segmentation, IDS.</li>
            <li><strong>Internet Layer:</strong> IP filtering, anti-spoofing, rate limiting.</li>
            <li><strong>Transport Layer:</strong> SYN cookies, firewall filtering, rate limiting.</li>
            <li><strong>Application Layer:</strong> WAF, CDN, rate limiting, CAPTCHAs.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Comparison of the OSI Model and TCP/IP Model</h4>
        <img src="osiandtcpmodel.png" alt="OSI Model Layers" style="width: 100%; max-width: 1650px; border-radius: 10px;">

        <h4>Functions of the Models</h4>
        <p>In real world networking, the TCP/IP model serves as the foundation for data transmission, widely utilized in diverse network infrastructures. Conversely, the OSI model, though not directly implemented, acts as a vital conceptual guide. It simplifies the intricacies of network communication, offering a structured perspective on how different components interact. Together, these models create a holistic understanding, connecting theoretical principles with practical execution in networking.</p>

        <h3>Transmission in Networking</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
            <h4>Transmission in Networking</h4>
    
            <p>In networking, <strong>transmission</strong> is basically how data gets sent from one device to another over some kind of medium. To get a better grasp of this, let's break it down into three key areas: <strong>types of transmission, transmission modes, and transmission media</strong>.</p>
            
            <h4>Types of Transmission</h4>
            <p>There are two main ways data can be transmitted: <strong>analog and digital</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Analog transmission</strong> uses continuous signals to send information, like how traditional radios broadcast music. The signals vary smoothly, kind of like sound waves.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital transmission</strong>, on the other hand, breaks data into discrete units—<strong>bits (0s and 1s)</strong>—which makes it way more efficient and reliable for modern communication, like the internet and phone networks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Transmission Modes</h4>
            <p>This refers to how data moves between devices. There are three main modes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Simplex:</strong> One-way communication, like a keyboard sending input to a computer—data only flows in one direction.</li>
                <li><strong>Half-duplex:</strong> Two-way communication, but not at the same time. Think of a walkie-talkie—only one person can talk at a time.</li>
                <li><strong>Full-duplex:</strong> Two-way communication <strong>at the same time</strong>, like a phone call where both people can talk and listen simultaneously.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Transmission Media</h4>
            <p>This is just the <strong>physical or wireless path</strong> data takes to travel between devices. It’s divided into two main categories:</p>
            
            <h4>Wired Media</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Twisted pair cables:</strong> Used in Ethernet and LANs.</li>
                <li><strong>Coaxial cables:</strong> Used for cable TV.</li>
                <li><strong>Fiber optics:</strong> Uses light pulses for super-fast internet connections.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Wireless Media</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Radio waves:</strong> Used for Wi-Fi and cellular networks.</li>
                <li><strong>Microwaves:</strong> Used for satellites.</li>
                <li><strong>Infrared signals:</strong> Used in remote controls.</li>
            </ul>
            
        </div>
    </div>

        <h3>Understanding the Differences Between Exploitation & Post-Exploitation</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
            
            <img src="exploitation.jpg" alt="OSI Model Layers" style="width: 99%; height: 400px; border-radius: 10px;">

            <p>Once an attacker gains a foothold in a target system, post-exploitation comes into play. This phase focuses on maintaining access, escalating privileges, Evasive Testing, Pillaging, Vulnerability Assessment, and gathering valuable data while staying undetected.</p>
    
            <p>To make it clearer, <strong>exploitation</strong> is when we attack the target from <strong>outside</strong>, aiming to gain initial access. This could be done by exploiting a vulnerability to get a <strong>reverse shell</strong> into their system.</p>

            <p>Once we are inside, we then decide what to do next whether to escalate privileges, maintain persistence, or move laterally. <strong>This phase is called post-exploitation.</strong> It's all about leveraging our access to gain more control, extract valuable data, and ensure we can come back later without detection.</p>

            <p>In short:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exploitation</strong> = Gaining access (e.g., reverse shell, RCE, phishing).</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Exploitation</strong> = What we do after access (e.g., privilege escalation, persistence, lateral movement).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If we gain access to a server that is already running with <strong>high privileges</strong> (such as root or administrator), the transition from <strong>exploitation</strong> to <strong>post-exploitation</strong> happens almost immediately. Since we already have elevated privileges, there’s no need for privilege escalation, and we can directly begin actions like <strong>maintaining access, extracting sensitive data, and moving laterally</strong> within the network. This rapid shift is an important distinction, as it allows attackers to quickly leverage their access without additional steps, making the system more vulnerable to further exploitation.</p>

        <h3>Linux System Enumeration</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
            
            <img src="enumeratingsyetm.jpg" alt="OSI Model Layers" style="width: 70%; height: 400px; border-radius: 10px;">

            <p>System enumeration is a critical step in privilege escalation, as it provides the necessary insights to understand how to gain higher access levels and reach your goal, whether that’s information exfiltration or system manipulation. Without proper enumeration, achieving your objectives is nearly impossible, as lower privilege accounts generally lack the necessary permissions for sensitive actions.</p>

            <p>To effectively escalate privileges, the goal is to gather information that helps you map out the system's structure, its security posture, and potential weaknesses. Here's what needs to be collected:</p>

            <ul>
            <li><strong>System Information:</strong> Gather OS version, kernel version, architecture, and installed patches to identify vulnerabilities or known exploits related to the system setup.</li>
            <li><strong>User Information:</strong> Identify the current user’s privileges, list all system users, and check for sudo rights. Understanding user roles and privileges is critical for identifying potential avenues for escalation.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Information:</strong> Map out network interfaces, routing tables, and active connections. This information is crucial for lateral movement and identifying potential attack vectors.</li>
            <li><strong>Running Services:</strong> List active processes, open ports, and scheduled tasks. Services can often provide elevated access or valuable insights into system configuration.</li>
            <li><strong>File System:</strong> Identify interesting files, check for permission issues, and review mounted drives. Misconfigured file permissions can often lead to privilege escalation.</li>
            <li><strong>Installed Software:</strong> Review applications and their versions, looking for outdated or vulnerable software. Exploiting these can lead to higher privileges or even remote code execution.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Mechanisms:</strong> Examine firewall rules, SELinux status, and AppArmor profiles. Understanding these mechanisms is key to bypassing security restrictions or detecting vulnerabilities.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I want to point out that system enumeration can be done manually, but there are also tools that automate this process. One such tool is <strong>Linux Privilege Escalation Awesome Script (LinPEAS)</strong>.</p>

            <p>LinPEAS is designed to automatically detect possible privilege escalation vectors on Linux systems. It scans the system for misconfigurations, outdated software, and other security weaknesses that could be exploited to gain higher privileges.</p>

            <p>You can download LinPEAS from the official repository: <a class="link" href="https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng" target="_blank">GPEASS-ng</a>.</p>

            <p>LinPEAS provides a rich, color-coded output to help users quickly identify potential security issues based on severity:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span style="color: red;"><strong>Red:</strong></span> Highly probable privilege escalation vectors</li>
                <li><span style="color: yellow;"><strong>Yellow:</strong></span> Potential privilege escalation vectors that require further analysis</li>
                <li><span style="color: green;"><strong>Green:</strong></span> General information useful for manual enumeration</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This feature enhances usability by allowing security professionals to distinguish between different risk levels efficiently.</p>

            <p><strong>Key Features of LinPEAS</strong></p>

            <p>LinPEAS is designed to automate the process of identifying privilege escalation opportunities. Its key features include, but are not limited to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Automated detection of common privilege escalation vectors</li>
                <li>Identification of misconfigurations in services, cron jobs, and SUID/SGID binaries</li>
                <li>Detection of credentials in files, environment variables, or process memory</li>
                <li>Checking for vulnerable software versions and known kernel exploits</li>
                <li>Analysis of sudo privileges and other permission-related issues</li>
                <li>Enumeration of sensitive information that could aid lateral movement</li>
            </ul>

            -P Indicate a password that will be used to run 'sudo -l' and to bruteforce other users accounts via 'su'
            -D Debug mode

        Network recon:
            -t Automatic network scan - This option writes to files
            -d [IP/NETMASK] Discover hosts using fping or ping. Ex: -d 192.168.0.1/24
            -p [PORT(s)] -d [IP/NETMASK] Discover hosts looking for TCP open ports (via nc). By default ports 22,80,443,445,3389 and another one indicated by you will be scanned (select 22 if you don't want to add more). You can also add a list of ports. Ex: -d 192.168.0.1/24 -p 53,139
            -i [IP] [-p [PORT(s)]] Scan an IP using nc. By default (no -p), top1000 of nmap will be scanned, but you can select a list of ports instead. Ex: -i 127.0.0.1 -p 53,80,443,8000,8080
             Notice that if you specify some network scan (options -d/-p/-i but NOT -t), no PE check will be performed

        Port forwarding (reverse connection):
            -F LOCAL_IP:LOCAL_PORT:REMOTE_IP:REMOTE_PORT Execute linpeas to forward a port from a your host (LOCAL_IP:LOCAL_PORT) to a remote IP (REMOTE_IP:REMOTE_PORT)

        Firmware recon:
            -f [/FOLDER/PATH] Execute linpeas to search passwords/file permissions misconfigs inside a folder

        Misc:
            -h To show this message
            -w Wait execution between big blocks of checks
            -L Force linpeas execution
            -M Force macpeas execution
            -q Do not show banner
            -N Do not use colours

        <h3>Think Before You Click (Security tips)</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
            <h4>A Click Can Cost You Everything</h4>
            <p>In today’s digital world, hackers don’t need brute force to break into your system, they just need you to click. One of the most common yet deceptive tricks used by cybercriminals is fake software updates or CAPTCHAs. These look exactly like legitimate update prompts from your system or browser, but in reality, they install malware, ransomware, or spyware on your device.</p>

            <p>Watch this short video to see the latest on this growing threat and how to protect yourself. <a class="link" href="https://tinyurl.com/2fraszxu" target="_blank">Youtube</a> important step to understanding this type of attack</p>

            <h4>How Fake Updates Work</h4>
            <p>Cybercriminals use social engineering tactics to make their fake update pop-ups look convincing. Here’s how they do it:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mimicking Trusted Software</strong> – Attackers design fake update prompts that look identical to real Windows, macOS, or browser updates.</li>
                <li><strong>Urgency & Fear</strong> – Messages like “Your security is at risk!” create a sense of panic, pushing users to act quickly.</li>
                <li><strong>Malicious File Downloads</strong> – Clicking on these fake updates often leads to downloading malware that steals data, installs keyloggers, or takes control of your system.</li>
                <li><strong>Fake Progress Bars</strong> – To add legitimacy, attackers include fake download animations to make the update seem real.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Real-Life Examples of Fake Update Attacks</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fake Chrome & Edge Updates</strong> – Attackers send pop-ups urging users to “update their browser,” but instead, they deliver Trojans that steal sensitive data.</li>
                <li><strong>Windows Security Update Scams</strong> – Users are tricked into downloading a supposed “critical patch” that is actually ransomware.</li>
                <li><strong>Fake Flash Player Updates</strong> – Despite Flash being obsolete, hackers still use fake Flash updates to infect systems with spyware.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>How to Protect Yourself</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Never Download Updates from Pop-Ups</strong> – Always update your system through official settings (Windows Update, macOS System Preferences, or software settings).</li>
                <li><strong>Verify Before Clicking</strong> – If an update notification appears, go to the official website and check for updates manually.</li>
                <li><strong>Look for HTTPS & Legitimate Domains</strong> – Never download software from third-party sites that aren’t officially linked to the provider.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Security Software</strong> – Enable antivirus programs and browser security warnings to detect malicious sites.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Final Thoughts: Stay Alert, Stay Safe</h4>
            <p>Cybercriminals rely on impulse clicks to spread malware. The next time you see an unexpected update prompt, <strong>pause and think before you click</strong>. Your digital security depends on it.</p>

        <h3>WebSockets</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
            <h4>What is a WebSockets?</h4>
            <p>WebSockets are a modern communication protocol that facilitates full duplex, real time data exchange between a client (typically a web browser) and a server. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, which follow a request-response model, WebSockets maintain an open connection, allowing both parties to send and receive data instantly over a single, persistent channel.</p>

            <p>WebSockets are widely used in modern web applications to facilitate real time communication, often transmitting sensitive data such as authentication tokens or user inputs. While WebSockets differ from traditional HTTP requests by maintaining a persistent, full duplex connection, many of the same security vulnerabilities such as cross-site WebSocket hijacking, sqli, XXE, SSRF, CSRF, insecure authentication, or lack of input validation can still occur if not properly mitigated.</p>
            

            <h4>Manipulating WebSocket traffic</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Intercept and modify WebSocket messages.</li>
                <li>Replay and generate new WebSocket messages.</li>
                <li>Manipulate WebSocket connections.</li>
            </ul>
