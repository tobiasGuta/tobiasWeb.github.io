            <img src="tryhackme.jpg" alt="Image of blog 1" style="width: 200px; height: auto;">
            <p>TryHackMe is a browser-based cyber security training platform, with learning content covering all skill levels from the complete beginner to the seasoned hacker. Our co-founders, Ben Spring and Ashu Savani launched TryHackMe after realising the inaccessibility of the industry. Learning cyber security previously entailed a black-box approach with a lack of guides and challenges, leaving the industry incredibly tricky for people to break into and difficult for those already in-market to upskill continuously.</p>

            <p>HTB Academy is cybersecurity learning the HTB way! An effort to gather everything we have learned over the years, meet our community's needs and create a "University for Hackers," where our users can learn step-by-step the cybersecurity theory and get ready for the training playground of HTB, our labs. All the way from guided to exploratory learning, learn how to hack and develop the hacking mindset that will enable you to assess and create secure systems. HTB Academy's goal is to provide a highly interactive and streamlined learning process to allow users to have fun while learning. Students are presented with material in digestible chunks with examples of commands and their output throughout, not just theory. Target hosts are provided so students can reproduce the materials presented in each section for themselves. There are hands-on exercises that serve as "checkpoints", and skills assessments to test students' understanding of the Module content.</p>
